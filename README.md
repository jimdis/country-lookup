Simple web app to lookup country data and convert currencies.

## Todos

Given more time I would do the following:

- Add react-router with routes for country codes (e.g. /:code) to render a page that triggers a fetch of country data.
- Fallback options on e.g. flag image with loading state.
- Theming with colors, spacing, fonts etc.
- Hide my fixer api key in a backend server
- Custom form validation in CurrencyConverter
- Save and cache search history (maybe in a sidebar with flags)
